# [Part 4: Forms and generic views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/intro/tutorial04/)

## [Write a minimal form](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/intro/tutorial04/#write-a-minimal-form)

```python
# polls/templates/polls/detail.html
<form action="{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}" method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
<fieldset>
    <legend><h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1></legend>
    {% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}
    {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
        <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">
        <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
    {% endfor %}
</fieldset>
<input type="submit" value="Vote">
</form>
```

A quick rundown:

- The above template displays a radio button for each question choice. The `value` of each radio button is the associated question choice’s ID. The `name` of each radio button is `"choice"`. That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, it’ll send the POST data `choice=#` where # is the ID of the selected choice. This is the basic concept of HTML forms.
- We set the form’s `action` to `{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}`, and we set `method="post"`. Using `method="post"` (as opposed to `method="get"`) is very important, because the act of submitting this form will alter data server-side. Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, use method="post". This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good web development practice in general.
- `forloop.counter` indicates how many times the [for](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/builtins/#std-templatetag-for) tag has gone through its loop
- Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too hard, because Django comes with a helpful system for protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.

```python
# polls/views.py
from django.db.models import F
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from django.urls import reverse

from .models import Choice, Question


# ...
def vote(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
    try:
        selected_choice = question.choice_set.get(pk=request.POST["choice"])
    except (KeyError, Choice.DoesNotExist):
        # Redisplay the question voting form.
        return render(
            request,
            "polls/detail.html",
            {
                "question": question,
                "error_message": "You didn't select a choice.",
            },
        )
    else:
        selected_choice.votes = F("votes") + 1
        selected_choice.save()
        # Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing
        # with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a
        # user hits the Back button.
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("polls:results", args=(question.id,)))
```

This code includes a few things we haven’t covered yet in this tutorial:

- [request.POST](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.POST) is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name. In this case, `request.POST['choice'] `returns the ID of the selected choice, as a string. [request.POST](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.POST) values are always strings.

    Note that Django also provides [request.GET](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.GET) for accessing GET data in the same way – but we’re explicitly using [request.POST](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.POST) in our code, to ensure that data is only altered via a POST call.

- `request.POST['choice']` will raise [KeyError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError) if `choice` wasn’t provided in POST data. The above code checks for [KeyError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError) and redisplays the question form with an error message if `choice` isn’t given.

- `F("votes") + 1` [instructs the database](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/models/expressions/#avoiding-race-conditions-using-f) to increase the vote count by 1.

- After incrementing the choice count, the code returns an [HttpResponseRedirect](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseRedirect) rather than a normal [HttpResponse](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse). [HttpResponseRedirect](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseRedirect) takes a single argument: the URL to which the user will be redirected (see the following point for how we construct the URL in this case).

    As the Python comment above points out, you should always return an [HttpResponseRedirect](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseRedirect) after successfully dealing with POST data. This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good web development practice in general.

- We are using the [reverse()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/urlresolvers/#django.urls.reverse) function in the [HttpResponseRedirect](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseRedirect)constructor in this example. This function helps avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function. It is given the name of the view that we want to pass control to and the variable portion of the URL pattern that points to that view. In this case, using the URLconf we set up in [Tutorial 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/intro/tutorial03/), this [reverse()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/urlresolvers/#django.urls.reverse) call will return a string like

    ```python
    "/polls/3/results/"
    ```

    where the 3 is the value of `question.id`. This redirected URL will then call the `'results'` view to display the final page.
